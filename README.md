Introduction

"I'm in the process of completing the Google IT Support Professional Certificate, where I’m learning troubleshooting, system security, and network administration. My training includes hands-on labs that are helping me develop the skills needed to handle a wide range of technical support issues.

At Fuyao, I learned the importance of process optimization in ensuring operational efficiency. When coordinating logistics, I constantly looked for ways to streamline processes, such as reorganizing routes to save time and reduce errors. In IT support, this same mindset will allow me to optimize how I manage support tickets and prioritize issues effectively.

In addition, my experience has strengthened my ability to stay calm under pressure. When things went wrong in the warehouse, I had to think on my feet and find solutions fast. I know this skill will help me provide users with prompt and effective IT support, no matter the urgency.

Finally, clear communication was essential in my logistics roles, where I worked with team members across departments to ensure smooth operations. In a help desk role, I’ll use this skill to explain technical information clearly to users and collaborate with other IT professionals. I’m excited to bring my analytical thinking, calm demeanor, and communication skills into an IT support environment."
